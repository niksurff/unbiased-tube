# Unbiased Tube

> In development and not published yet.

A browser extension that removes popularity counts (views, likes, subscribers etc.) from popular video sites (i.e. YouTube).

This is an experiment.

Do you feel biased towards certain videos due to a low or high count?
Are these counts helpful? I don't have the answers, yet.


## Development

Source code is located in the `extension` folder.
Have a look at `package.scripts` inside `package.json` for common commands.
